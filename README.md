# The-Pollsters


## Objective:
Election polls, like any other polls, is an opinion survey designed to indicate the opinion of the population. Social media platforms like Twitter contain a multitude of data that can be used to analyze the trend. These platforms contain large amounts irrelevant data, so the data we use for our polls needs to be selected carefully. 
In this project, we used NLP and statistical methods to predict if a tweet is political or non-political, and if political, the political party orientation of the tweet. Our experiments show that while the the general pre-processing techniques used on the text corpus are useful, additional pre-processing done on the tweets increased the accuracy of the predictions.

## Data
The Raw data is extracted using the public twitter API. We collected 52,000 tweets from various accounts with distribution show in Figure 1. For the democrats the data is collected from the official democrats account, from Joe Biden’s account, from Bernie Sanders account and few other officials who represent the Democrats party. For the republicans the data is collected from the official republicans account, from Donald Trump’s account and also from other ocials who represent the Republican Party. For the Non – Political tweets the data is selected from various twitter accounts on music, food, movies etc.
